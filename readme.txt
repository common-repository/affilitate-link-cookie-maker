== Description ==

To make sure affiliate link cookies are activated upon page visit and not by link clicking. 
Put the shortcode in stead of a normal link Use: [afflink url="url" name="name"]

Please read the FAQ about the question if it is legal to use this technique!

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the folder `affiliate-link-cookie-maker` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

To use it please use the double quotes. So an URL like 'http://zafrira.net/?p=1466' with
the name 'affiliate test link' would result in the following shortcode:
`[afflink url="http://zafrira.net/?p=1466" name="affiliate test link"]`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does it do? =

It simply makes a very very small iframe to the url where you would direct your visitor to 
and it generates a link that will be displayed in your post or page.
The iframe should be able to receive the cookie.

= Why would i want to use it? =

Sometimes when you use an affiliate url the visitor does not click on your link but will
for example search the supplier on google.
That way you would loose the commision you would have received if the visitor would have 
clicked on your link.
So this way you can avoid this.

= Is it magical? =

No, it is very basic.
If your visitor does not allow cookies, this plugin won't help that.

= Is it legal? =

In some cases it is not legal to use this way of affiliate linking.
In some countries it might not be allowed by law. Please check this before you use it.
Also in some cases it might not be allowed by your affiliate link provider.
Please be wise and check this! I do not have a list of countries where it is allowed and
where not.
